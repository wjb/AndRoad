== Dependencies

AndRoad depends of the following projects

* osmdroid (http://code.google.com/p/osmdroid/)
* apache-mime4j-0.6.jar
* libgoogleweatherapi.jar
* libQuadTree.jar
* libTpegML.jar
* slf4j-android-1.5.8.jar
* httpmime-4.0.1.jar
* libosmapi.jar
* libSpatialIndex.jar

== Compilation

There is no apk yet available. You need
* android sdk from http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
* java sdk from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
* ant from http://ant.apache.org/

After configuring the path of your android sdk in the file
local.properties, you just execute ant install while your phone is
connected to the computer.

== Install

Download the apk from http://fabien.carrion.free.fr/AndRoad.apk

In the Parameter screen on your phone, you have to unlock the
possibility to install an unsigned application. Parameters -->
Applications --> Unknown Sources.

Plug your phone with the USB connection, transfer the file to your
phone, unplug your USB cable. Now, on your phone, browse to the SD
Card directory where you have stored the APK file using any file
browser you wish available on the Android Market.

Your phone will once again be very unhappy that you wish to install an
unsigned software but at least this time it should allow you to.

== Feedback

This is a work in progress. Comments should be made on the
androad@googlegroups.com mailing list at the moment. Contributions are
always welcome.
